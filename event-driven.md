What is event driven micro service architecture?

What happens in an event-driven architecture?
When a service performs an action of interest, the service will produce an event. If a service needs to react to the event, they can subscribe to the service events. 

This differs than request/response services. Event driven architecture deals with commands/events. 

Request/response services are synchronous. While event driven architecture are asynchronous.



How can we implement a basic event driven architecture?
- Sample implementation in golang, nodejs
